# Clinical trial intelligence on Exasol

Ask a clinical-trial question in English. An agent writes the SQL, runs it against
Exasol, and answers citing the trial IDs it used. Ask for a landscape instead and
the same data produces a structured report you can send on.

The point the demo makes is not that the engine is fast. It is that **"pembrolizumab
in the US" is 538 trials, or 304, or 50**, depending on three judgements nobody
usually writes down — and that a semantic layer is where those judgements belong.

```
./lake/up.sh             # object storage + an Iceberg catalog (2 containers)
./lake/install_engine.sh # the lakehouse engine into Exasol
./02_load_exasol.sh      # shred the committed snapshot into tables
./03_semantic_layer.sh   # the views, and the resolution layer
./04_build_vectors.sh    # embed offline, load 25.8M rows, install the UDFs
./00_preflight.sh        # GO / NO-GO, 15 checks
./app/run.sh             # the demo, on http://127.0.0.1:8503
```

## What it does

**Three pages.** The challenge, the demo, and how Exasol does it.

**An agent, over MCP.** Claude reaches the database through
[`exasol-mcp-server`](https://github.com/exasol-labs/exasol-mcp-server): it reads
the schema, writes its own SQL, runs it, and cites NCT ids. No query is written
for it, and it reaches Iceberg tables in object storage the same way it reaches
native ones, because a virtual schema is just a schema.

Query execution is **off by default** in that server. Turn it on with
`EXA_MCP_SETTINGS={"enable_read_query": true}`, or the agent can only describe
the schema and never query it.

**Report generation.** A keyword such as *"What is the current trial landscape for
Pembrolizumab in US"* produces a structured report — scope, trials, sponsors,
phase, status, geography, endpoints, publication linkage — downloadable as
Markdown, and convertible with `bin/md2pdf.py`. The sections and their SQL are
fixed, so the same keyword always produces the same document; the model writes
only the summary, over numbers already computed.

**A resolution layer** (`sql/07_resolution.sql`) that publishes its judgements
instead of burying them:

| Judgement | Measured on pembrolizumab |
|---|---|
| Which names are the same drug | 732 by literal name, **760** with aliases — 28 trials say only Keytruda or MK-3475 |
| Which sponsors are one company | 4 strings roll up to Merck & Co.; **Merck KGaA is a different company** and stays separate |
| What "in the US" means | **538** has-a-US-site · **304** US-only · *US-led is not derivable — the registry has no sponsor country* |

Every report opens by stating which reading it took and what the alternatives
would have given.

## The second source, and the second storage tier

Trials are in the warehouse. The evidence that a trial ever produced a *result*
is not, so PubMed publications live in a **lakehouse** -- Iceberg tables on
object storage -- and are never loaded into Exasol. They are read at query time
by `exasol-labs/lakehouse-engine-rs`, a Rust UDF running DataFusion inside the
database, and joined to native tables in one statement:

```sql
SELECT t.PHASE, COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT p.NCT_ID) AS NO_PUBLICATION
FROM CT.V_LANDSCAPE t                                    -- native Exasol
LEFT JOIN CT_LAKE.TRIAL_PUBLICATIONS p ON p.NCT_ID = t.NCT_ID  -- Parquet on S3
WHERE t.STATUS_GROUP = 'Completed' AND t.PHASE_IS_STATED
GROUP BY t.PHASE;
```

The join key is real: PubMed carries the registry number as a DataBank
accession, so this is an equi-join on `NCT_ID`, not title matching.

**65.8% of completed Phase 3 trials have no linked publication.** Say the caveat
with the number: a paper that never cites its NCT number is invisible to this
join, so it is a lower bound on reporting, not proof a trial went unpublished.

Cost of the second tier, measured: a native count is ~330ms and a lake count
~490ms, both including client connect time -- so reaching the lake costs about
**160ms**, not 490.

### Two things the vendor install path cannot do here

- `deploy/scripts/install.sh` targets a Personal *local* deployment **over SSH**
  and also requires `exapump`. This Personal build publishes no `sshPort` and
  ships no `node_access.pem`. It does not matter: on the local backend the VM
  shares `/exa` with the host, so BucketFS is a directory and "upload" is `cp`.
  `lake/install_engine.sh` does what the installer would have done, directly.
- The bundled `docker-compose.lakekeeper.yml` brings Keycloak, Postgres,
  Lakekeeper and MinIO. `lake/docker-compose.yml` uses MinIO plus
  `iceberg-rest-fixture` -- the same Iceberg REST interface, two containers
  instead of five, because every container is one more thing that can fail to
  start on a conference floor.

### The failure that will waste your afternoon

Every S3 request is signed with the **VM's** clock. After the host sleeps, that
clock can freeze while the hardware clock stays right, and then every lake query
fails with `403 PermissionDenied` / `RequestTimeTooSkewed` -- which reads exactly
like bad credentials and is not. Both `lake/up.sh` and `00_preflight.sh` check
the skew and print the fix, which needs no restart:

```
(cd ~/.exasol/personal/deployments/default/local/runtime && <launcher> run -- hwclock -s)
```

## What it needs

`docker`, and an Exasol Personal deployment running locally (`exasol status`
should say `database_ready`) with the PYTHON3 SLC installed. Everything reaches
the database through the Exasol CLI: `exasol connect` for SQL, `IMPORT FROM
LOCAL CSV FILE` for bulk load, and a plain `cp` into the BucketFS directory the
VM shares with the host. There is no separate load tool and no SSH to the node.

## The one design idea

Exasol has no vector type and no vector index. So vectors are stored **long and
narrow** — one row per dimension — and cosine similarity is an ordinary join and
`GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT v.NCT_ID, v.CHUNK_ID, SUM(v.VAL * q.VAL) AS SIM
FROM CT.ELIG_VECTORS v JOIN QV q ON q.DIM = v.DIM
GROUP BY v.NCT_ID, v.CHUNK_ID
```

Vectors are L2-normalised at build time, so a dot product *is* cosine. 25.8M
rows scan in about 5 seconds. Everything expensive — the TF-IDF fit, the SVD —
happens offline in Docker with sklearn pinned to the version the Exasol SLC
ships, because otherwise the pickle will not unpickle inside the UDF.

## What the data will and will not tell you

Measured on the loaded snapshot (12,404 trials), not quoted from documentation:

| Dimension | Reality |
|---|---|
| sponsor, status, geography, indication | Structured and reliable |
| **phase** | 34.4% say `NA` — "not applicable". `WHERE PHASE='PHASE3'` silently drops a third of the landscape, so the view exposes `PHASE_IS_STATED`. |
| **endpoint** | Free text only (`measure` + `timeFrame`). Derived by pattern into 18 categories; **35.7% still land in "Other / unclassified"** and that number is reported, not hidden. |
| **comparator** | Half structured: `armGroup.type` codes whether a control exists, but *which* drug it is sits in the arm label as prose. |
| **eligibility** | One free-text blob. There is **no** structured inclusion/exclusion field — the split is recovered here from prose headings, and 97.3% of chunks resolve to a definite section. |

## The failure, which is the point

Ask for trials that *exclude* prior PD-1 exposure and the fourth hit is
`NCT02595866`, whose criterion reads **"No prior treatment with anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1"** — in the INCLUSION section. The opposite of the question.

Cosine cannot separate it: **0.9987 against 0.9990**. BM25 scores it *higher*
than two correct rows. The reason is one query away:

```sql
SELECT TERM FROM (SELECT CT.QUERY_TERMS('No prior treatment with anti-PD-1') FROM DUAL);
SELECT TERM FROM (SELECT CT.QUERY_TERMS('Prior treatment with anti-PD-1') FROM DUAL);
```

Identical. `no` is an English stopword, so the analyzer deletes the negation
before any scoring happens. Both rankers are blind, and fusing two blind
rankers does not restore sight.

What fixes it is not a bigger model. It is the recovered `CRITERION_SECTION`
column, applied before scoring:

| | recall@20 | section purity |
|---|---|---|
| text alone | 0.675 | 0.763 |
| with the structured section filter | **0.858** | **1.000** |
| — hybrid questions | 0.713 → 0.925 | 0.769 → 1.000 |
| — polarity questions | 0.600 → **0.725** | 0.750 → 1.000 |

The worst single case is `pol-02`, *"no prior systemic chemotherapy for
metastatic disease"* — **recall 0.15**, because the negation this time is in the
**query**, and the analyzer deletes it there too.

## A second failure the section filter cannot fix

Ask for `EGFR mutation positive`, filtered to INCLUSION, and at **rank 13**
comes *"EGFR mutation or ALK mutation was **negative**"* -- cosine 0.9455, in
INCLUSION, the half we asked for. (The starkest example, *"EGFR mutation
negative and ALK fusion negative"* in `NCT07633873`, sits at rank 52; an earlier
draft of this file called it the top hit, which it is not -- the number here is
measured, and `bin/ui.py` recomputes the rank on every run rather than quoting
it, because a rank moves whenever the corpus does.) Here `negative` is **not** a
stopword -- it survives tokenisation intact. The vector space simply does not encode that it inverts the
meaning, and BM25 sees a term match. Both the right and wrong criteria sit in
INCLUSION, so **the structured section filter offers no rescue at all**: recall
stays at 0.65 even with it applied (`pol-04`).

So there are two distinct polarity failures, not one:

| | mechanism | fixable by the section column? |
|---|---|---|
| "no prior treatment with X" | stopword deletion — `no` is removed before scoring | Yes, partly |
| "EGFR mutation negative" | antonymy — the token survives, the meaning does not | **No** |

Polarity is the category the structured filter helps *least*, because the
retrieval still cannot tell the two sentences apart; the filter only stops it
looking in the wrong half.

## Honesty

- All eval gold sets are `snapshot-sql`: reproducible predicates over the loaded
  data, **not** an independent ground truth. Review-derived questions are
  outstanding and tracked in `eval/REVIEW_QUESTIONS.md`.
- The vector side is TF-IDF + 96-dim SVD, not a transformer. It explains only
  18% of variance and its similarities are compressed into a narrow band near
  1.0, so *relative* order carries the signal and absolute scores mean little.
  A transformer would retrieve better and would be **just as blind to `no`**.
- The API advertises no rate limits, and the snapshot is committed anyway: a
  booth demo must never depend on the venue network.

A Streamlit page built as an ARGUMENT, not a tool, so it works with nobody
standing next to it. Four acts, each **challenge → how Exasol addresses it →
what the audience should notice**:

| Act | Challenge | What answers it |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Half the question has no column | a vector is 96 rows, cosine is a `GROUP BY` |
| 02 | The registry omits more than it states | a layer that publishes its own coverage |
| 03 | Similarity cannot see the word "no" | a column recovered from prose, filtered *before* scoring |
| 04 | The data is never all in one place | a lakehouse virtual schema, joined in one statement |

Every number is queried live when the page loads — nothing is typed in. Two of
the four acts end by admitting a limit, which is the point: the stopword proof
is computed by `CT.QUERY_TERMS` on the spot, and the antonymy blind spot reports
its *current* rank rather than a remembered one.

The second tab turns any question into SQL in front of the audience; the third
is the scope board — what this demo will not claim.

Stdlib only. Runs every question BOTH ways -- text alone and with the structured
section filter -- side by side, and highlights in red any top-ranked row that came
from the wrong criteria section. Preset buttons load the two known failures.
