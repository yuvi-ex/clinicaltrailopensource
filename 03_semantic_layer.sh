ask <<'Q'
Which of our six dimensions can the registry actually answer?

  Structured and reliable : sponsor, status, geography, indication
  Structured but LOSSY    : phase -- a third of trials say "not applicable"
  DERIVED, not looked up  : endpoint -- the registry gives free text only
Q
say "3b. Phase: what a naive WHERE PHASE='PHASE3' would silently drop"
xsql "SELECT PHASE, COUNT(*) AS TRIALS,
             ROUND(100*COUNT(*)/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(),1) AS PCT
      FROM CT.V_TRIALS GROUP BY PHASE ORDER BY TRIALS DESC;"

say "3c. Endpoint: the cost of free-text outcomes"
xsql "SELECT ENDPOINT_CATEGORY, COUNT(*) AS N,
             ROUND(100*COUNT(*)/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(),1) AS PCT
      FROM CT.V_TRIAL_ENDPOINTS WHERE OUTCOME_KIND='PRIMARY'
      GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY N DESC;"

say "3d. Comparator: half a WHERE clause, half retrieval"
xsql "SELECT COMPARATOR_DESIGN, COUNT(*) AS N FROM CT.V_LANDSCAPE GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY N DESC;"
say "STEP 3 DONE — say the 'unclassified' number out loud before anyone asks"
